Interpreter and Translator for TestOut LabSims
## How to
To use the "TestFuck-Interpreter" you must go to the [Bookmarks file](https://github.com/DeadTheAmazing/TestFuck-Interpreter/blob/main/bookmarks.txt) and by making bookmarks on your device of both of the JS commands you are nearly complete.
After that go to any TestOut LabSim and start and score the exam so you get the answers. Run the "grab" bookmark. Copy the Toast's Text and then start a new session of the exam. Once loaded, run the "do" bookmark and paste the JSON into the prompt. Watch as all the questions get answered!
